I had the opportunity to spend an hour discussing Redshift tips for performance, service nuances, and gotchas for the AWS Webinar Content series. This is worth a watch if you're currently utilizing Redshift and feel that you might be missing out on some performance due to gaps in your existing implementation.This session is now hosted on YouTube here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atXNUnttjh0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atXNUnttjh0)

Towards the end of the webinar there is a pseudo-demo where I interpret the results of various SQL commands against the system tables. I think this shows a solid method to identify actionable recommendations for any workloads currently running on Amazon Redshift today. The SQL is also available for your download, a link is provided at at the 27:00 mark in the video.

Let me know what you think, and feel free to reach out with any feedback.
